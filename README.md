#Netflix Review Analyzer
The C# Netflix Review Analyzer is a data driven GUI application that accesses reduced files of a Netflix database to show statistical data of movie reviews. This particular program is made of 4-tiered design to access data from the database: the presentation tier with all of the front -end C# GUI code, the business tier that provides the basic interface for accessing and transforming data (builds the SQL query), the data access tier which does the actual SQL calls to the database, and the database itself which is a simple Microsoft data file (mdf).

The easiest way to run the program is to just clone it and open up the Visual Studio solution.
